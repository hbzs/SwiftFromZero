 1. Create a constant called `age1` and set it equal to 42.
 Create a constant called `age2` and set it equal to 21.
 Check using Option-click that the type for both has been inferred correctly as `Int`

 2. Create a constant called `avg1` and set it equal to the average of `age1` and `age2` using the na√Øve operation `(age1 + age2) / 2`.
 Use Option-click to check the type and check the result of `avg1`. Why is it wrong?

 3. Correct the mistake in the above exercise by converting `age1` and `age2` to type Double in the formula.
 Use Option-click to check the type and check the result of `avg1`. Why is it now correct?

 1. Create a string constant called `firstName` and initialize it to your Ô¨Årst name.
 Also create a string constant called `lastName` and initialize it to your last name.

 2. Create a string constant called `fullName` by
 adding the `firstName` and `lastName` constants together, separated by a space.

 3. Using interpolation, create a string constant called `myDetails` that uses the `fullName` constant to create a string introducing yourself.
 For example, my string would read: "Hello, my name is Matt Galloway.".

 1. Declare a constant tuple that contains three Int values followed by a Double.
 Use this to represent a date (month, day, year) followed by an average temperature for that date.
 */

 2. Change the tuple to name the constituent components.
 Give them names related to the data that they contain: month, day, year and averageTemperature.
 3. In one line, read the day and average temperature values into two constants.
 You‚Äôll need to employ the underscore to ignore the month and year.
 4. Up until now, you‚Äôve only seen constant tuples. But you can create variable tuples, too.
 Change the tuple you created in the exercises above to a variable by using var instead of let.
 Now change the average temperature to a new value.

 1. Create a constant called `coordinates` and assign a tuple containing two and three to it.

 3. Which of the following are valid statements?

 4. Is this valid code?

 8. What is the value of the constant named summary?
